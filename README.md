#### SCALED EMOTES PLUGIN

This plugin allows you to customize emote size, like so:

##### SPECIFIC SETTINGS

On the Plugins tab of BetterDiscord settings you will see the Scaled Emotes plugin. When you click settings you will see multiple input boxes.

Type the dimension for each type of emote, up to 128:

* **Regular emotes**: Standard Discord emotes as well as Twitch sync'd ones, displayed on normal messages.
* **Jumboable emotes**: Discord and Twitch-sync'd emotes that are displayed at bigger sizes when the message consists solely of emotes.
* **BetterDiscord emotes**: FFZ and BetterDiscord emotes - these are usually lower resolution and might not scale well.

And _**click Save**_.

Make sure the plugin is enabled and you should be good to go.

###### TYPICAL SETTINGS

Regular Discord emotes are size 22, and jumboable emotes are size 32. BetterDiscord emotes vary.

I recommend the 32 - 64 - 32 setting. Regular emotes will be a bit bigger, and jumboable meotes will be doubled in size, which provides quite the improvement.

Feel free to experiment with these values and report if anything breaks.

#### WORD HIGHLIGHTER PLUGIN

This is a plugin that lets you highlight words like this:

##### SPECIFIC SETTINGS

On the Plugins tab of BetterDiscord settings you will see the Word Highlighter plugin. When you click settings you will see a text box.

Type the words you want to highlight, _**one per line**_.

And _**click Save**_.

Make sure the plugin is enabled and you should be good to go.
